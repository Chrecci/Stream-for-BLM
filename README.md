# Stream-for-BLM

Zoe Amira released a great video that you can stream to generate ad revenue to support the #BlackLivesMatter movement. This automates the streaming process using Python

NOTE: As good as it is to generate free revenue to support the cause, please take time to actually watch the video itself. It highlights numerous Black artists and talents, and is heavily worth a full watch.

How to install (for complete beginners):

1. Download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - If this is your very first installation, make sure to install Python 3.8 for your device
  - Instructions can be found here (may want to watch 1.5x speed): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nHFBhCfFo
  - Most important thing is to make sure during setup, you select "Add Python 3.8 to PATH"
