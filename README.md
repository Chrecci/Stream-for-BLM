# Stream-for-BLM

Zoe Amira released a great video that you can stream to generate ad revenue to support the #BlackLivesMatter movement. This automates the streaming process using Python

NOTE: As good as it is to generate free revenue to support the cause, please take time to actually watch the video itself. It highlights numerous Black artists and talents, and is heavily worth a full watch.
