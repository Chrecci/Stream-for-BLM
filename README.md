# Stream-for-BLM

This is the testing branch. If you're here I assume you know what you're doing. Time intervals are greatly shortened between actions for effective testing. Code is simple and short, and documented for ease of editing. As tempting as it is to use packages such as Selenium, please do not forget that the purpose of the code is to 1. still generate ad revenue for creator, and 2. Not be detected as a bot. If there's any questions/concerns/recommendations please reach out to me via chrecci@gmail.com

Zoe Amira released a great video that you can stream to generate ad revenue to support the #BlackLivesMatter movement. This automates the streaming process using Python

NOTE: As good as it is to generate free revenue to support the cause, please take time to actually watch the video itself. It highlights numerous Black artists and talents, and is heavily worth a full watch.
